forEach(): Executes a provided function(callback) once for each array element. Doesnâ€™t return anything (undefined) but this callback is allowed to mutate the calling array.

map(): Executes a provided function(callback) once for each array element and creates a new array with the results of this executions. It cannot mutate the calling array content.

Conclution Use map() when you need to return a new array, use forEach() or for when you want to change the original array.
